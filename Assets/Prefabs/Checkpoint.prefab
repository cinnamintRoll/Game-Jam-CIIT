  m_text: "The majority of the people who encountered them never survived, \n\nthe
    rest were permanently disturbed\r\n\nThe survivors described the creature as
    a walking corpse with antlers, \n\nblending in with the trees\r\n\nThe creature
    is said to lead their victims in a dark forest, \n\nblinding them so they could
    barely see where they're going\r\n\nAnd summoning a seemingly endless pit in
    front of them\r\n\nIf that doesn't work, the monster reveals themselves. \r\n\nI
    have met this creature before\n\nI was visiting my old school with my mother\n\nShe
    had to take a few folders with her and consult with a coworker\n\nWhile she was
    busy, I took the opportunity to explore the school grounds \n\nIt was beginning
    to be dark outside, but I wasn't bothered by it\n\nSoon, I found myself at the
    far edge of school grounds where I was met with a forest\n\nI opened my phone
    for some light, but quickly realized it was running low on battery\n\nI turned
    it off. Did I not charge it earlier? \n\nI decided I would return back to my
    mother, but the school was no longer there\n\nI now found myself in the middle
    of a forest\n\nI opened my phone. Relying on its dim light and hoping that it
    won't shut down immediately\n\nI walked around, watching my steps\n\nBecause
    of my phone's dim light, I could barely see what was in front of me so I had
    to be careful\n\nWalking slowly, I found a large pit just a few inches from where
    I lay standing\n\nI now realize, that I am not alone \n\nSo I walked a little
    faster, noticing my phone is now on 2%\n\nMore and more pits showed up out of
    nowhere, and I avoided them\n\nSoon, larger trees started to appear in front
    of me\n\nI was panicking, but at the same time excited and surprised on how I
    keep avoiding obstacles\n\nMy phone was about to die and there's still no sign
    of the school or any light\n\nThen I met them\n\nRight in front of me, a silhouette\n\nThe
    figure is wearing a long, dirty cloak, and slowly looking up, I see its ribcage
    exposed\n\nI paused for a moment before I could look at the figure's face\n\nA
    deer or a man's decomposing face, and antlers that appear to be infinitely reaching
    the sky\n\nThey look at me, a face showing uncertainty perhaps, or simply waiting
    for me to scream\n\nI did not scream. I did not think. I hugged the creature
    because why not? \n\nThe creature disappeared and I was hugging a tree \n\nI
    was finally back in school grounds\n\nWhat I did surprised me\n\nMaybe that's
    how you escape a nightmare, you face it and embrace it (literally) \n\nBut my
    story doesn't end there\n\nI need to see them again\n\nIt must be so lonely out
    here"
